Yo', this is Corey.  This is the "BONES" of our group project so if you're not used to JAVA I put some
simple steps for you guys to follow.

1.) Download NetBeans and NotePad++ to your PC.  NetBeans is just a standard easy to use IDE for Java, and
NotePad++ is just the second coming of Jesus and YOU SHOULD ALREADY HAVE IT!

2.) Make a folder called "Database" and put all of the files in it (Course, Student, StudentDatabase).

3.) Click File

4.) Java -> Java Application

5.) Do not let it make the main anything for you and save this shits somewhere you can find it.

6.) Just move the Java Package "DateBase" into your Source Packages, and then you can look through the code
and all of my comments.

7.) IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS CALL ME!  This is a team project, so if you get stuck CALL ME SO I CAN HELP YOU!
We die together on this, CALL ME IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SKYPE, STEAM, DISCORD, I don't give a flying fuck
just don't be outa' the know and NOT LETTING ME KNOW YOU'RE OUT OF THE KNOW.  I will stare at you in class with
shame eyes if you do.

That's all.
- Corey
